I'm a self-taught programmer who's passionate about making software skills and technology as a whole more accessible to everyday people. Through my projects, I want to help people with no prior programming experience learn to use complex technologies by tailoring them for practical use in our daily lives. I mainly code in Python and emphasize machine learning and data science for pipeline-based analysis. As an aspiring data scientist, I enjoy creating repos to document Python libraries, specifically for CSV dataframes. I've also served as a data analyst for BASIS Shavano's University Interscholastic League chapter and a teaching assistant for an AP Computer Science course, which has prepared me to take on data-centered roles in the workplace.
